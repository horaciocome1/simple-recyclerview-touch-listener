## Getting Started
Android library that abstracts, and completely hide, the GestureDetector part of an recyclerview click, and press, events implementation. Leaving to the developer only the task of implementing what happens when such events occurs.
Compatible with androidx.
[Latest legacy version](https://github.com/horaciocome1/simple-recyclerview-touch-listener/releases/tag/0.2.2)


## Pre-requisites
To be able of testing and implementing this library, the developer should have a working recyclerview list with some data on it.

## Adding to your project
Lets start by adding a corresponding repository in your _root_ `build.gradle` file.
```gradle
	allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
 ```
The next task is to add the dependency to your _app_ `build.gradle` file.
```gradle
	dependencies {
          ...
	        implementation 'com.github.horaciocome1:simple-recyclerview-touch-listener:0.2.2'
	}
```
Now you ready to go. You might want to _**sync your project**_ first.

## How to use
```kotlin
    recyclerView.addOnItemClickListener { view, position -> 
        // handle clicks
    }
    
    recyclerView.addOnItemDoubleClickListener { view, position ->
        // handle double clicks
    }
    
    recyclerView.addOnItemLongPressListener { view, position -> 
        // handle long presses
    }
```

Its not mandatory to implement all at once. Perhaps you just need to handle long presses. In that case you should only implement `setOnItemLongPressListener( ... )`.
```kotlin
    recyclerView.addOnItemLongPressListener { view, position -> 
        // handle long presses
    }
```

## Troubleshooting
You might face poor java support.
